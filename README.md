Whole exome sequencing (WES) has been commonly used in clinical settings to help with diagnosis and explore the genetic basis of rare mendelian diseases. Given its advantages over gene panel testing, WES still has several hurdles that limit physicians or clinical geneticists' application of such techonology.
Some of the hurdles identified:
  - Prioritization: 10,000 + variants identified per-patient, most of them 	have unknown significance. 
	- Interpretability

This pipeline is specifically designed for physicians and clinical interpretation of WES variants.
